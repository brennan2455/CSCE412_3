				<h2>Why engineering?</h2>
				<p>I am a computer engineer currently working on finishing my degree at Texas A&M university. I have been enrolled since fall of 2018 and am currently in my junior year by hours.When I was younger, I was not sure exactly what I wanted to do other than I wanted something engaging and challenging. Whenever I was introduced to engineering, it immediately caught my attention due to the problem solving and opportunity to be challenged all the time. I enjoy engineering because of the challenges and excitement it brings to life. Each day, while you may have a certain routine you follow, chances are you won't experience the same problems day by day as you might with other jobs. Every day brings new challenges and new opportunities to learn. </p></div>

				<h3>About me:</h3>
				<p>Besides being a full time student here at TAMU, I have had work experience as a Lifeguard and a Head lifeguard. Both of these positions involved teamwork and a great deal of team building to establish an understanding between the members of what each person should be doing in x, y or z scenarios. For example: if a child has had a cut, or bug sting, one or more of the lifeguards will attend to the child while the other/s go to find the child's guardian. Both positions offer some degree of patron or customer interaction, however being a head lifeguard significantly increased the number of interactions I would have with the guests at the pool. I would often be the one to receive compliments or questions about the facility, or have to deal with problems that people had with the facility or any situations that came up at the pool. These could include things as simple as giving someone directions or asking them to be a bit less rowdy, to asking a family to leave for any extraordinary circumstances. My experience as a guard and headguard have helped me develop great communication and teamwork skills.
				<br><br>Outside of work or school related things, I try to be as active and physical as I can, going to the gym and playing sports with friends. I bake and cook almost every day, trying new things and combinations to see what tastes good and what doesn't for use in the future as a home cook. I have also started teaching myself to play guitar on the side because only playing video games during free time can be fun, but not super engaging.</p>

			<h3>Previous projects:</h3>
			<p>At current, the only projects that I have worked on are those for my classes. In the future I would like to work on the hardware aspect of computer engineering whether that's using HDLs or designing the silicon that goes into making the chips, or even other aspects of technology I have yet to explore.</p>
		</div>
		<div class = "services">
			<h3>How I would like to contribute:</h3>
			<p>I have not done much in the ways of contributing or giving back to the community except for tutoring and helping others when they are having trouble if I'm able to. In the future I would like to take a more active role in services, possibly becoming a full time tutor if I can juggle it with my workflow.</p>
		</div>
		<div class = "qual">
			<h3>Qualifications:</h3>
			<p>In terms of qualifications, I have worked with C++, C, Java, Python, Verilog, now Javascript, CSS and html. I have worked on many projects in classes using c++, Python and Verilog, and am looking forward to developing projects using html, Javascript and CSS in the near future.  The languages I am most proficient at right now are C++ and Verilog. It has been a while since I have worked with Python, the last time being 2018 and 2019, however it has been even longer since I have used java, the last time being when I was in highschool around 2015-2016. I still have the underlying coding experience though, so it shouldn't be too difficult to pick up the languages I haven't used recently, or even some new ones on the way.</p>
