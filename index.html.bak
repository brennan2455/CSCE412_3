	special for the industry. <br><br>

<p>
	I am a computer engineer currently working on finishing my degree at <br>
	Texas A&M university. I have been enrolled since fall of 2018 and am <br>
	currently in my junior year by hours. I enjoy engineering because of <br>
	the challenges and excitement it brings to life. Each day while you <br>
	may have a certain routine you follow, chances are you won't experience <br>
	the same problems day by day as you might with other jobs. Each day <br>
	brings new challenges and new opportunities to learn <br><br>
	
	At current I have not had any internships with tech companies or <br>
	worked for companies in a way that would involve my major. I have <br>
	however had work experience as a Lifeguard and a Head lifeguard. <br>
	Both of these positions involved teamwork and a great deal of team <br>
	building to establish an understanding between the members of what <br>
	each person should be doing in x, y or z scenarios. While both <br>
	positions also offer some degree of patron or customer interaction, <br>
	being a head lifeguard significantly increased the number of <br>
	interactions I would have with the guests at the pool. I would often <br>
	have to deal with problems that people had with the facility or any <br>
	situations that came up at the pool, and thus developed better <br>
	communication skills because of it. <br><br>
	
	In terms of qualifications, I have worked with C++, C, Java, Python, <br>
	Verilog, now Javascript, CSS and html. It has been a while since I <br>
	have worked with Python, the last time being 2018 and 2019, however <br>
	it has been even longer since I have used java, the last time being <br>
	when I was in highschool around 2015-2016. I have worked on many <br>
	projects in classes using c++, python and Verilog, and am looking <br>
	forward to developing projects using html, Javascript and CSS in <br>
	the near future.<br>
